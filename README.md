# Become a full-stack developer: Migrating a company from GCP to AWS
### COM209

In this dev chat, learn how you can become a full-stack developer in one year. Hear from a developer who relaunched their content creation platform The Capital in July 2022. The chat covers their journey since being hired for a first developer role in June 2021. A position turning Figma designs into divs evolved into a lead role in a migration to AWS, including rewriting a Google OAuth flow in Amazon Cognito, deploying an API with AWS AppSync, configuring AWS Lambda functions, and building an Amazon DynamoDB NoSQL database using AWS Amplify. Find out more about this journey and how you can embrace your own future as a developer.
